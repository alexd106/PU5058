# # Wait: why can't we use information from the 'summary(M1)' or 'anova(M1)' functions
# # to do this?
# 
# # the 'summary' table tests if the coefficient for each explanatory variable
# # is significantly different from zero.
# 
# # the 'anova' tests for the significance of the proportion of variation explained
# # by a particular term in the model.
# 
# # The ANOVA table also allows testing the overall significance of a categorical explanatory
# # variable (like FGRAZE) which involves several parameters together (one for each level),
# # which is quite is handy. But the results of this ANOVA are based on sequential
# # sums of squares and therefore the order of the variables in the model
# # (which is arbitrary here) matters.
# 
# # We could change the order but there are too many possible permutations.
# # Summary P values don't suffer from this problem but tests different hypotheses.
# # It would be useful to use an ANOVA that doesn't depend on the order
# # of inclusion of the variables, this is effectively what 'drop1' does.
# 
# drop1(M1, test = "F")
# 
# # LOGLDIST is the least significant (p = 0.88), and therefore makes the least
# # contribution to the variability explained by the model, with respect to

# 
# # the LOGAREA:FGRAZE term represents the interaction between LOGAREA and
# # FGRAZE. This is significant (p = 0.005) and so our model selection
# # process comes to an end.


## ----Q10, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE-------------------------------------------------
# # As the interaction between LOGAREA and FGRAZE was significant at each step of
# # model selection process the main effects should be left in our model,
# # irrespective of significance. This is because it is quite difficult to
# # interpret an interaction without the main effects. The drop1
# # function is clever enough that it doesn't let you see the P values for the
# # main effects, in the presence of their significant interaction.
# 
# # Also note, because R always includes interactions *after* their main effects
# # the P value of the interaction term (p = 0.005) from the model selection
# # is the same as P value if we use the anova() function on our final model
# 
# # Check this:
# anova(M5)
# drop1(M5, test= "F")


## ----Q11, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE-------------------------------------------------
# # Biologically: confirming what we already found out in the previous exercise:
# # There is a significant interaction between the area of the patch and the level
# # of grazing
# 
# # However, some observations are poorly predicted (fitted) using the set of
# # available explanatory variables (i.e. the two very large forest patches)
# 
# # Interpretation:
# # Bird abundance might increase with patch area due to populations being more
# # viable in large patches (e.g. less prone to extinction),
# # or perhaps because there is proportionally less edge effect in larger
# # patches, and this in turn provides more high quality habitat for species
# # associated with these habitat patches
# 
# # The negative effect of grazing may be due to grazing decreasing resource
# # availability for birds, for example plants or seeds directly, or insects
# # associated with the grazed plants. There may also be more disturbance of birds
# # in highly grazed forest patches resulting in fewer foraging opportunities
# # or chances to mate (this is all speculation mind you!).
# 
# # Methodologically:
# # Doing model selection is difficult without intrinsic / expert knowledge
# # of the system, to guide what variables to include.
# # Even with this data set, many more models could have been formulated.
# # For example, for me, theory would have suggested to test an interaction
# # between YR.ISOL and LOGDIST (or LOGLDIST?),
# # because LOGDIST will affect the dispersal of birds between patches
# # (hence the colonisation rate), and the time since isolation of the patch may
# # affect how important dispersal has been to maintain or rescue populations
# # (for recently isolated patches, dispersal, and hence distance to nearest
# # patches may have a less important effect)

# # This time, we are not doing any specific hypothesis testing, rather we are
# # attempting to select a model with the 'best' goodness of fit with the minimal
# # number of estimated parameters.
# 
# # We will start with a reasonably complex but PLAUSABLE model (this is the same
# # model we started with using F test based model selection above.
# 
# M.start.AIC<- lm(ABUND ~ LOGLDIST + LOGDIST + YR.ISOL + ALT + LOGAREA + FGRAZE +
#                LOGAREA:FGRAZE, data = loyn)
# 
# drop1(M.start.AIC)


## ----QA2, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE-------------------------------------------------
# # So, our starting model with no variables removed has an AIC of 228.20. If we
# # remove the interaction term `LOGAREA:FGRAZE` from the model then this results
# # in a big increase in AIC (238.02 - 228.20 = 9.82) so this suggests that there
# # is substantial evidence that the interaction should remain in the model. The
# # models without `LOGLDIST`, `LOGDIST`, `YR.ISOL` all have pretty much the
# # same AIC value (around 226) so in practice we could remove any of them. Let's
# # remove the term that results in the model with the lowest AIC which is the
# # `LOGLDIST` variable (AIC 226.23).
# 
# M2.AIC <- update(M.start.AIC, formula = . ~ . - LOGLDIST)
# drop1(M2.AIC)


## ----QA3, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE-------------------------------------------------
# # Ok, as the model without the variable `YR.ISOL` has the lowest AIC (224.27)
# # let's update our model and remove this variable.
# 
# M3.AIC <- update(M2.AIC, formula = . ~ . - YR.ISOL)
# drop1(M3.AIC)


## ----QA4, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE-------------------------------------------------
# # So, now the model without `LOGDIST` has the lowest AIC (222.43) so we should
# # refit the model without this variable and run `drop1()` again.
# 
# M4.AIC <- update(M3.AIC, formula = . ~ . - LOGDIST)
# drop1(M4.AIC)


## ----QA5, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE-------------------------------------------------
# # And the model without the variable `ALT` has an AIC of 221.57 which is about
# # the same as the model with `ALT` (AIC 222.43), so let's remove this variable
# # from the model as this suggests that the simpler model fits our data just as
# # well as the more complicated model.
# 
# M5.AIC <- update(M4.AIC, formula = . ~ . - ALT)
# drop1(M5.AIC)
# 
# # OK, so now we have a model with the main effects of LOGAREA, FGRAZE and the
# # interaction term LOGAREA:FGRAZE. When we remove the interaction term the
# # AIC value increases by 8.9 (230.47-221.57) and this suggests that if we
# # remove the interaction term the model fit is significantly worse. Therefore we
# # should leave it in and finish our model selection here.
